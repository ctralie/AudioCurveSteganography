Main Goals
* The hidden data should be audibly imperceptible (though it does not need to be statistically imperceptible)
* The hidden data should be robust to compression
* The hidden signal should be robust to channel noise and echoes
* It should be possible to decode the data without any prior knowledge like a key
* The hidden data should be robust to frame misalignment, or it should be possible to recover a frame alignment without any prior information
* It should be possible to stream the image as the audio is playing
