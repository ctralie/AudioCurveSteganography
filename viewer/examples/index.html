        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In this work, we create artistic closed loop curves that trace out images and 3D shapes, which we then hide in musical audio as a form of steganography. We use traveling salesperson art to create artistic plane loops to trace out image contours, and we use Hamiltonian cycles on triangle meshes to create artistic space loops that fill out 3D surfaces. Our embedding scheme is designed to faithfully preserve the geometry of these loops after lossy compression, while keeping their presence undetectable to the audio listener. To accomplish this, we hide each dimension of the curve in a different frequency, and we perturb a sliding window sum of the magnitude of that frequency to best match the target curve at that dimension, while hiding scale information in that frequency's phase. In the process, we exploit geometric properties of the curves to help to more effectively hide and recover them. Our scheme is simple and encoding happens efficiently with a nonnegative least squares framework, while decoding is trivial. We validate our technique quantitatively on large datasets of images and audio, and we show results of a crowd sourced listening test that validate that the hidden information is indeed unobtrusive.

                <b>1/16/2024</b>: <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uoeCltsAAAAJ&hl=de">Dr. Dmytro Isonov</a> from TU Dresden created a geocaching puzzle at <a href = "https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCAJ173">this link</a> which uses this code as part of the puzzle!

                <b>1/9/2024</b>: The original version of this paper modified non-overlapping STFT windows individually, but this sometimes leads to audible "clicks," especially in quieter regions of the audio (such as around ~27 seconds into the Usher tune).  To improve this, I introduced a new parameter <b>L<SUB>T</SUB></b>, as dubbed by Hu/Wu/Lee in their recent paper "<a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099448">FFT-Based Dual-Mode Blind Watermarking for Hiding Binary Logos and Color Images in Audio</a>," which came out around the same time as my paper.  This parameter introduces a small buffer in between each non-overlapping frame to allow for smoother transitions.  See section III of their paper for more details.
                <p>
                    I've added a new example as the first 2D example below showing this on the Usher tune, but I've left the original examples there as well.  You'll hear the difference towards the end of the usher tune with <b>&lambda;=0.1</b>.  Beyond that, I've updated some of the other examples, which I've indicated below.

                <b>1/10/2024</b>: I added support for true-type fonts as an alternative to stipple patterns on images.  Have a look at <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie/AudioCurveSteganography/blob/main/viewer/examples/barry-text-2d.ipynb">this notebook</a> for an example.  This particular example shows how to embed the word "Barry" inside of a 30 second clip from <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB54XUhA9_w">this tune</a>.  I'm also showing that example below.
